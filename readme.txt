WHAT IS SINGLE FILE PHP GALLERY?

Single File PHP Gallery is a web gallery in one single file. All you have to do is copy the script to any directory containing images to make a gallery. Sub directories will be sub galleries. Thumbnails for images and directories are generated automatically. Descriptions for galleries and images can be added by making a simple text file.
Single File PHP Gallery does not require any configuration or programming skills to use.

You can see how it looks in the on-line demo here:

  http://sye.dk/sfpg/

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

* Make sure NOT to place any content from untrusted sources in the gallery. Code or scripts embedded in files could be sent to the end users, and could be executed.

* The gallery contains an Admin option, which allow users to upload, delete, move, rename and create directories, images and files in the gallery.
  If using this option, make sure that only administrators have access to the gallery.
  Do not put the gallery unprotected on a public web server with this setting enabled. See the ADMIN option for details.
  For this to work, PHP needs permission to create, modify and delete in the GALLERY_ROOT.

* The gallery contains an automatic clean-up function that deletes unused files in DATA_ROOT.
  The gallery will clean up files in the DATA_ROOT that are no longer used by the gallery. So make sure not to use the DATA_ROOT for storing anything.
  The clean up routine is activated when viewing a directory where the number of subdirectories, images and/or files have changed since last access to the directory.
  For this to work, PHP needs permission to delete in the DATA_ROOT.

* The gallery contains an option to delete images older than a set number of days. If using this option, make sure to have a backup of all your images in the GALLERY_ROOT.
  For this to work, PHP needs permission to delete in the GALLERY_ROOT.


____________________________________________________________
NEWS IN THIS VERSION

* Added Upload option to the admin functions.
* Changed keyboard navigation to only have effect when viewing images. Except Esc, which can also be used for jumping a directory up.
* Fixed the need to double click on elements on touch devices (iOS).
* Fixed bug that made some servers not being able to use the admin option to move files.
* Minor code cleanup changes.


____________________________________________________________
REQUIREMENTS

For this gallery to function you will need the following:
* A web server capable of running PHP 5 scripts.
* The PHP GD library (php_gd) installed. See here for information: http://php.net/gd
* PHP write access to server.
* PHP memory limit large enough to contain both full size image and preview/thumb (converted to BMP) See the FAQ section for further information on this.


____________________________________________________________
HOW TO USE / QUICK START

The only thing you have to do is place a copy of the index.php file to any directory of your web.
When this is done all images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif) and files if enabled, in that directory and all sub directories will be shown in the gallery.

By default the script will try to create a folder called "_sfpg_data" in which thumbnails, previews and information is saved. This can be changed using the DATA_ROOT constant. If PHP only have write access in a certain folder, change the DATA_ROOT to point there.


____________________________________________________________
TIPS / FAQ

 * If some or all thumbnails is missing or show up as a red X, the reason could be that the full images is too big for the php-engine to load them into memory. You will then have to do one of the following:
     1. Make the full images smaller
     2. Increase the memory_limit in php.ini. (If the memory_limit is 8MB, it gives a maximum image size on about 1600*1600)
 * If no thumbnails or images show, it could be that the script does not have the php tag "<?php" as the very first. The php tag must come before any other output. A blank line above or even a space before the tag will render the script useless. This can also happen if the auto_prepend_file option in php is used.
 * Single File PHP Gallery does not have to be called index.php, you can rename it to whatever you like.


____________________________________________________________
SUPPORT / REQUESTS / HELP / CONTACT

If you need help getting Single File PHP Gallery to work, then please start by running the SFPG TEST script file on the server. The SFPG TEST script is a normal PHP page, and you can download it from the Single File PHP Gallery page. The script tests to see if the requirements for the script to run are met, and generates an output explaining what could be the issue. If the output from the script does not provide enough information for you to make the script work, then please use the contact form on the Single File PHP Gallery page. Describe the issue you are having and also copy/paste the information from the SFPG TEST script along with the description.

If you have comments, questions, requests, greetings etc. regarding Single File PHP Gallery, please use the contact form on my page.

____________________________________________________________
KNOWN ISSUES

 * If a thumbnail for a given image exists, it will be used. So remember to delete old thumbnails if you make changes to the way thumbnails are created. If, for an example, you change the size of thumbnails, you will need to delete the old ones already saved, in order to have the changes apply, and have new thumbnails created. This is by design, and will not be fixed.
 * First access to a gallery containing many images or directories, will take a long time to load, because the script have to create thumbnails for all the images. If the script timeout, the rest of the folders will be left without thumbnails and information. Then just refresh the page and the script will continue from where it came. The folder where the script stopped might not have a thumbnail. If this is so just click the gallery, and the thumb will be created. This is by design.
 * Images smaller than preview size will still have preview size images created, and will also have the option to load full-size, even though they is the same size.
 * Single File PHP Gallery version 4.x is a stand-alone gallery. It is not designed to be included on existing pages. This is by design.
 * Editing description for images, files or directories will remove line breaks from the description file. HTML line breaks made with <br> will of cause still be effective when viewing the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
CONFIGURATION INFORMATION

The script can be edited in a plain text editor. Open the index.php and you will find the configuration section at the top of the script.

Refer to the descriptions below for configuration.


____________________________________________________________
define('GALLERY_ROOT', './');

Set the path of the gallery root, where the images and sub directories containing images is placed.
The default value is './' which is the directory where the script is placed.
If SHOW_FILES is TRUE, the files will only be downloadable if a relative path like the one in example 1 is used.

GALLERY_ROOT should always end with a slash like the examples below.

Example 1: './images/'
Example 2: $_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT].'/gallery/images/'
Example 3: '/users/bob_the_user/wwwroot/images/my_pictures/'


____________________________________________________________
define('DATA_ROOT', './_sfpg_data/');

Set the path to where thumbnails and other data should be saved. PHP needs to have write access to this directory. If PHP only have write access in a certain directory, change the DATA_ROOT to point there.

By default DATA_ROOT points to a directory called _sfpg_data in the same directory where the script is placed. If the directory do not exists, the script will try to create it. The _sfpg_data directory is by default excluded from the gallery, using the $dir_exclude option.

DATA_ROOT should always end with a slash like the examples below.

Example 1: './thumbs/'
Example 2: $_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT].'/gallery/thumbs/'
Example 3: '/users/bob_the_user/data/sfpg_thumbs/'


____________________________________________________________
define('SECURITY_PHRASE', '');

Manually set, or have the gallery generate a random phrase. The SECURITY_PHRASE is used to make the gallery URL's tamper resistant to avoid creative or malicious use.

If the gallery is accessed and this option is not set, then the gallery will insert a random string of chars into the script.

If the script can't edit itself, a text is displayed, explaining that the SECURITY_PHRASE have to be set manually.

INFO: PHP needs permissions to edit the script itself, for the script to set the SECURITY_PHRASE automatically.
INFO: Data stored in the DATA_ROOT uses this phrase. So if this option is changed, the contents of DATA_ROOT directory must be deleted. The data will then regenerate automatically. Also if this option is changed all URLs/links containing the sfpg parameter will end up in the root of the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('PASSWORD', '');

Set the password that will give access to the gallery.
Set to '' to not password protect the gallery.

If set to anything but '', the gallery will be protected by password.
The gallery uses PHP sessions when logging in, which require the client to accept cookies. If the client do not accept cookies, the user will be prompted for password over and over again.
Entering a wrong password or not accepting cookies will simply display the login form again. No error is displayed.

IMPORTANT: Know that images can, and most likely will, be cached by the browser. So make sure to only access the gallery when using a "Private Window", "Incognito", "InPrivate Browsing" or what ever your browser calls it when not logging and saving anything.
IMPORTANT: Know that unless you are using a HTTPS connection, the entire content of the gallery including the password when you login, text and images are sent unencrypted over the internet.
IMPORTANT: Remember that the password is stored in the gallery script in clear text, so anyone with access to the files on the server, can read it.


____________________________________________________________
define('ADMIN', FALSE);

** WARNING ** SETTING THIS OPTION TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN FALSE WILL ALLOW USERS TO UPLOAD, DELETE, RENAME, MOVE and CREATE DIRECTORIES, IMAGES AND FILES IN THE GALLERY_ROOT **

Set to FALSE to disable the administrator functions.
Set to TRUE to allow users to access the administrator menu, where the following options are available:
 1. Upload of files to the gallery.
 2. Rename, move, and delete images and files.
 3. Rename, move, delete and create directories.
 4. Create, edit and remove descriptions for directories, images and files.
 5. Create, edit and remove PayPal selling information for images.

IMPORTANT: Do not put the gallery unprotected on a public server with this setting enabled.
IMPORTANT: Make sure that only administrators have access to the gallery, when this option is enabled (set to TRUE).

The PASSWORD option can be used to protect the gallery, when this setting is enabled.

If you want to have a public gallery and also want to allow administrators to login and use the admin functions, do like this:
 1. Configure the public gallery as you want (remember to set the SECURITY_PHRASE to a random string of chars). Leave the ADMIN setting to FALSE, and the PASSWORD setting to '', which will make it accessible for all.
 2. Make a copy of the public gallery, for the administrators to use. Name it as you like. The important thing is that the SECURITY_PHRASE is the same in both copies.
 3. Set a good, secure and unique password in the PASSWORD option, in the administrator copy of the gallery.
 4. Set ADMIN to TRUE, in the administrator copy of the gallery.
 5. Now only link to the public gallery on your page. But use the administrator copy to login and administer as needed.

When this option is set to TRUE, the "Admin" button will be shown in the bottom menu. Click it to enter administrator menu.

While in the administrator menu: Clicking an element (directory, image or file), will select the element (will be highlighted). Clicking a selected elements will deselected the element again.

INFO: Uploading or Moving files to a directory that already contains files with the same name, will overwrite the files without confirmation.
INFO: Deleting a directory will also delete all files inside the directory - Keep in mind that there could be files that are not shown in the gallery.
INFO: Deleting, moving or renaming a file will also, if they exists, delete, move or rename the thumbnail (defined by FILE_THUMB_EXT) and the description (defined by DESC_EXT) for the file.
INFO: Deleting, moving or renaming an image will also, if they exists, delete, move or rename the description file (defined by DESC_EXT) and the selling file (defined by PAYPAL_EXTENSION) for the image.

To upload files or images to the gallery:
 1. Click the "Admin" button.
 2. Click the "Upload" button.
 3. Click the first button, normally called "Browse" or "Choose Files" (browser dependend).

 4. Browse to the directory you want to move the selected elements.
 5. Confirm.

To rename elements from the gallery:
 1. Click the "Admin" button.
 2. Click the element (only one) that should be renamed.

INFO: Using these options require PHP to have permission to create, edit and delete in the GALLERY_ROOT.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_NAME_FILE', '_name.txt');

Set the name of the file that can be placed in every directory of the gallery.
If a file with the given name is found, the first line of text from the file will be used instead of the directory name. Directories will still be sorted after the actual name.

IMPORTANT: The file name in this setting must end with the extension in DESC_EXT. Dafault value for DESC_EXT is '.txt'.

TIP 1: This is useful if you would like to use chars that cannot be used in directory names.
TIP 2: See SORT_DIVIDER for an easy way of sorting directories, images and files.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_THUMB_FILE', '_image.jpg');

Set the name of the image that can be placed in every directory in the gallery.
If an image with the given name is found, it will be used as thumbnail for that directory. The image will not be displayed inside the directory.

You can also place an image with the given name in the ICONS_DIR, to have it used as thumb on all directories that do not have images inside.

TIP 1: This is very useful when having directories with only files of non-supported image types for download.
TIP 2: You do not have to resize the image, it will be resized like all other images in the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_DESC_FILE', '_desc.txt');

Set the name of the description file that can be placed in every directory of the gallery (including the GALLERY_ROOT).
If a file with the given name is found, the text will be shown in the gallery. Text can include HTML tags.

IMPORTANT: The file name in this setting must end with the extension in DESC_EXT. Default value for DESC_EXT is '.txt'.
INFO: See DIR_DESC_IN_GALLERY and DIR_DESC_IN_INFO for placing the description in the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_BANNER_FILE', '_banner.txt');

Set the name of the banner file that can be placed in every directory of the gallery (including the GALLERY_ROOT).
If a file with the given name is found, the text in the file will be shown in the gallery, above the thumbnail boxes. Text can include HTML tags.

If the TEXT_BANNER option is defined, and the DIR_BANNER_FILE is found in a directory, only the DIR_BANNER_FILE text is displayed in the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_DESC_IN_GALLERY', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have description shown in the gallery as the first element, using a thumbnail box that is twice as wide as normal thumbnail boxes.
Set to FALSE to not show description in the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_DESC_IN_INFO', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have description shown in the information box.
Set to FALSE to not have description shown in the information box.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_SORT_REVERSE', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to sort directories in reverse order (highest to lowest).
Set to FALSE to sort directories in normal order (lowest to highest).

See also DIR_SORT_BY_TIME and SORT_ALL_NATURAL for other sorting options for dirs.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_SORT_BY_TIME', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to sort directories by modified time.
Set to FALSE to sort directories by name.

The modified time of a directory is normally updated when changes is made to the contents of the given directory. Even deleting a file or image can make the directory "new". (This might differ from platform to platform).

See also DIR_SORT_REVERSE and SORT_ALL_NATURAL for other sorting options for dirs.


____________________________________________________________
$dir_exclude = array('_sfpg_data', '_sfpg_icons');

Set an array of directory names that should not be shown in the gallery.

Directory names should be entered in lower case.
Exclusion is not case sensitive. If you exclude 'oldimages', all the following directories will all be excluded: 'OldImages', 'oldImages', 'OLDIMAGES' and so on.

Example 1: array('cgi-bin');
Example 2: array('cgi-bin', 'include', 'old_images');

See also $file_exclude and $file_ext_exclude for other ways of excluding elements from the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_EXCLUDE_REGEX', '');

Use regular expressions to exclude directories from gallery view.
See here for syntax: http://php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php

Set to TRUE to have images sorted by time found in EXIF, when sorting images by time.
Set to FALSE to use filetime when sorting images by time.

The EXIF information, including EXIF time, is extracted when the thumbnails are generated, so sorting images by EXIF time will first be effective from second view of the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('ROTATE_IMAGES', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have images rotated according to the orientation information in EXIF.
Set to FALSE to not rotate images.

Rotated images are saved on the server in the DATA_ROOT. This could take up a lot of disk space.

Rotating images will require twice the amount of memory, than that for generating thumbs.


____________________________________________________________
define('IMAGE_JPEG_QUALITY', 90);

Set the quality for jpeg images. Range from 0 (worst quality and smallest file size) to 100 (best quality and largest file size).
If images have been saved on server you will have to delete them in order to have changes to this setting apply.

INFO 1: Can be set to any of the supported image types.
INFO 2: Case sensitivity in this constant follows the case sensitivity of the server on which the script runs.
INFO 3: Extensions should be entered with a dot in front, like the default and the example below.

Example: If set to '.jpg' and one of the files is named 'In_The_Snow.avi'. You can then make an image called 'In_The_Snow.avi.jpg', and place it in the same folder as the image.

INFO 1: Extensions should be entered in low case with a dot in front, like the examples below.
INFO 2: Exclusions works only on non-supported file types. You cannot exclude the supported image types.
INFO 3: Exclusion is not case sensitive. If you exclude ".txt", all files with the following extensions will be excluded: ".txt", ".Txt", ".TXT" and so on.

The default exclusions are there because:
'.php' to not show the gallery it self, or other php files.
'.txt' to not show text files, as they by default are used for description.

define('FILE_EXCLUDE_REGEX', '');

Use regular expressions to exclude files from gallery view.
See here for syntax: http://php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php


____________________________________________________________
define('ICONS_DIR', '_sfpg_icons/');

Set the name of the directory where images to be used as thumbs for file types can be placed. If changed remember to also change the $dir_exclude option to not show it inside the gallery.
The directory must be placed inside the GALLERY_ROOT. The directory needs to end with a slash, like the default one: '_sfpg_icons/'.

The files in this directory must be the type defined by the option FILE_THUMB_EXT, by default: '.jpg'.
The name of the files should be the name of the extensions that they should be used for.
For an example if a file named "iso.jpg" is placed in this directory, all files ending with .iso will be given this image as thumb.

INFO: All images in ICONS_DIR should be entered in lower case, like the example above.
INFO: This option is optional. If not used, the directory does not need to exist.


____________________________________________________________
define('LINK_BACK', '');

Set a URL to show a button that will function as a link to the set URL. This can be used as a "Back to my site" button.
Set to '' to not show the button.

Example 1: Set to '/' to have button take you to the root of your web.
Example 2: Set to 'http://www.yoursite.com/page.html'.

See TEXT_LINK_BACK for the text on the button.


____________________________________________________________
define('CHARSET', 'utf-8');

Set the charset to be used. In order to have special chars display correctly, a charset that support the chars used in the gallery, must be set.

Below is a short list of charsets that can be used (use a search engine on the Internet for others):

Chinese Traditional:       'big5'


____________________________________________________________
define('DATE_FORMAT', 'Day Date Month Year Hour:Min:Sec');

Set the format of the date/time to be used in the gallery.
The following variables can be used:

Day      : Day name. Shown as: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
Date     : Day number. Shown as: 1-31
Month    : Month name. Shown as: Jan, Feb, Mar...
Nrmonth  : Month number. Shown as: 1-12
Year     : Year. Shown as: 1960-
Hour     : Hours. Shown as: 00-23

____________________________________________________________
define('DESC_EXT', '.txt');

Set the extension of the description files. Place a file with the same name as an image or file with the set extension added to the image name, to have the text shown with the image or file.

Case sensitivity in this constant follows the case sensitivity of the server on which the script runs.
Extensions should be entered with a dot in front, like the example below.

Example: If set to '.txt' and one of the images is named
         "IMG_10a.jpg". You can then make a file called
         "IMG_10a.jpg.txt", and place it in the same folder as the image.

If SHOW_FILES is set to TRUE you can use $file_ext_exclude to exclude the description files from the view. So if you would like to list .txt but don't want the descriptions files shown, you should set to any other extension that you do not use (feel free to use ".sfpg") and exclude that one using $file_ext_exclude.
	 

____________________________________________________________
define('DESC_NL_TO_BR', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to have line breaks in description files translated to the HTML <br> tag, to act as a line break in the browser.
Set to FALSE to ignore line breaks in description files. To make a line break with this setting, simply add <br> at the end of each line in the description file.


____________________________________________________________
define('SORT_DIVIDER', '--');

Set the string that will function as a divider between the part of the name to sort after and the name to be shown.
SORT_DIVIDER works on directories, images and files.

Example: If you have a directory called "Apples" and one called "Bananas", and would like "Bananas" to be the first one on the list. You could then call them: "001--Bananas" and "002--Apples". The directories will then be listed in the order you like, and only the text after the SORT_DIVIDER string will be shown.


____________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________
define('PAYPAL_ENABLED', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to enable selling items in the gallery using PayPal.
Set to FALSE to disable PayPal selling.

Using the PayPal option requires write access to the GALLERY_ROOT, for updating the "in stock" count when items are being sold.

Using the PayPal option:
If you have an item you want to sell, you first need to have an image of it, as only images can have a price. Files and folders in the gallery can't be sold.

To enable selling first set PAYPAL_ENABLED to TRUE, then either use the administrator option to set the price, or do it manually.

To manually set an image up for sale:
Lets say you have an image called 'My first painting.jpg'. You then have to make a sell file, which is a text file with the same name as the image with the PAYPAL_EXTENSION added.
By default the PAYPAL_EXTENSION is '.sell'. Making it look like this:

My first painting.jpg
My first painting.jpg.sell

In the 'My first painting.jpg.sell' file there should be two or three lines, like this:

------ FILE CONTENT STARTS BELOW THIS LINE ------
19.95
1
Paint001
------ FILE CONTENT ENDS ABOVE THIS LINE ------

The first line '19.95' is the price for the item.
The second line '1' is the amount you have for sale. In this example there are only one for sale.
The third line is optional. In this example 'Paint001' is a unique identifier you can use to keep track of your inventory. It will be written in the information from PayPal when a sell is completed. If the third line is omitted the path and image name is put in its place. Just keep in mind that the path and image together, may not be longer than 127 chars(a limit set by PayPal).

The price, amount and unique item identifier will be shown in the information box when you hover the mouse over the thumb, and also when the image is shown in full.
If the second line in the sell file is larger than 0, the 'Buy this item' button (also shown in information box) will be active. If the number is 0 the 'Buy this item' button will be disabled (Sold out).

When a user clicks the 'Buy this item' button, then first the sell file is checked to see if the item is still available, then a unique file is generated in the DATA_ROOT/buy/ and finally the user will be redirected to PayPal.
If the user completes the PayPal payment, the user is then sent back to the gallery using a special link, which is then matched with the unique file in DATA_ROOT, which is then used to decreases the amount in the sell file by one.
If the user cancels the buy, they will be sent back to the item in the gallery, and the amount is untouched. Every time a user clicks 'Buy this item', unused unique files in DATA_ROOT/buy/ older than one week, are removed.

You should however always check the status of the amount you have for sale when an item have been sold, as the user buying the item might not end the buy by returning to your site, and so the amount is not decreased. If this is the case, you will then have to decrease the amount by one yourself.
